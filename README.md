**FEM Vascular Flow**

This project implements a finite element methods (FEM) model to study blood flow and pressure drop in an idealised branching vascular network.

*The goal is to investigate:*

* how flow is distributed across terminal branches, and

* how the overall pressure drop changes across the network,

* and how these results behave under mesh refinement.
